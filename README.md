# LightField
Synthethize a lightfield photo with a video - enables the user to refocus and change camera aperture AFTER the image is taken
This project provides a low-cost alternative to industry scale light field modules with much higher flexibility.
*This project is homework 6 on Northwestern CS331: Introduction to computational photography

# Usage
To generate light field images from videos, run part1_lightfield.ipynb on Jupyter Notebook, and change video input in the data_part2 folder when prompted
To synthesize camera aperture and focus points, run part2_synthetic.ipynb on Jupyter Notebook. Change the video input in the data_part2 folder when prompted. 
In the output, move the ipywidgets for viewing images with shifted focus points.
